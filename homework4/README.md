# Story Description.

This depicts a simple game.  The usecase is defined in Trello, in [here](https://trello.com/b/NUASSvH5/javascript-basic).

## As a **USER**

I want to see a 100 X 150 rectangle in the page, which will increment its width and height by 100px every second until it reaches a width of 900px.

It will also reduce it's width and height by 10px every time the rectangle is clicked

The rectangle will stop its growth when it reaches a width of 10px.
